Hello everyone!  
  
I'm starting my journey into **computer graphics programming** by creating this [GitHub profile](https://github.com/cppikigai/). While I have some experience in other programming areas, I'm starting here from scratch.  
If you're interested in my projects or my journey, feel free to reach out to me via email at [cpp.ikigai@gmail.com](mailto:cpp.ikigai@gmail.com).  
I plan to share daily progress reports in the notes on the pages of [my blog](https://github.com/cppikigai/blog/tree/main), which I'll set up within a separate repository. Since I have a full-time job, I won't have a lot of time for this blog, but my goal is to dedicate at least 3-4 hours each day to learning computer graphics programming.
